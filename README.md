# Tuition-Center-Management-System
Group Assignment (Year 1 - Semester 2)
This Tuition Center Management System is a school assignment developed by a total of four members over three months.
This system was developed using object-oriented programming techniques and the C# programming language.
There are a total of 4 types of registered users in this system: receptionist, student, tutor, and admin. 
Each user has different and unique features that can only be accessed by the respective user.
Generally, every user should log in to the system with their respective username and password.
The system will then verify the user's credentials based on user data stored in the database and identify their respective roles.
Each user can perform actions that are accessible on their homepage. For instance, a receptionist can register a student and enroll the student, which could be performed through feature buttons on their respective home pages.
Also, this system implements a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the user interface as well as a SQL database technique to store data.
